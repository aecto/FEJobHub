Amazon Web Services launched its China (Beijing) Region (operated by Sinnet) in September 2016 and its China (Ningxia) Region (operated by NWCD) in December 2017.

</p><p>Stanowisko to podlega:</p>
Finance Manager<p></p><p><b><br>
Key Responsibilities (China-Focused, with Cross-Border Coordination)</b></p><p>
China Treasury Operations &amp; Liquidity Management
</p><ul><li>Lead day-to-day China treasury operations, including cash positioning, short-term funding, and intercompany fund transfers within mainland China, ensuring optimal liquidity for local companies and branches.</li><li>
Manage onshore RMB fund pools and coordinate with banks to streamline cross-border fund flows (e.g., dividend repatriation, intra-group loans) in compliance with SAFE regulations (e.g., cross-border RMB settlement, FDI/ODI reporting).</li><li>
Forecast China cash flows (monthly/quarterly) and collaborate with regional/global treasury to align with the group&rsquo;s overall liquidity plan, identifying funding gaps/surpluses specific to the Chinese market.</li></ul><p>
FX &amp; Interest Rate Risk Management
</p><ul><li>Hedge FX exposures arising from China-based operations (e.g., export/import settlements, cross-border procurement, or payments to offshore service providers).</li><li>
Manage onshore interest rate risks (e.g., floating-rate RMB loans from domestic banks) using tools like interest rate swaps or RMB interest rate options, considering PBOC policy shifts (e.g., LPR adjustments, reserve requirement ratio changes).</li><li>
Monitor China-specific market factors (e.g., RMB exchange rate volatility against USD/EUR, PBOC daily fixing, capital controls) and provide actionable insights to mitigate risks.</li></ul><p>
China Financing &amp; Investment Execution
</p><ul><li>Source and optimize onshore financing for China operations, including RMB bank loans, supply chain finance (e.g., domestic accounts receivable discounting), and bank acceptance drafts.</li><li>
Invest idle RMB funds in compliant instruments (e.g., structured deposits, money market funds, short-term government bonds) to maximize returns while adhering to regulatory limits (e.g., safe haven rules for corporate cash investments).</li><li>
Support M&amp;A or capital expenditure projects in China by structuring local funding solutions (e.g., project finance, equity co-investment) and coordinating with domestic legal/financial advisors.</li></ul><p>
Regulatory Compliance &amp; Local Stakeholder Management
</p><ul><li>Ensure full compliance with China&rsquo;s foreign exchange regulations (SAFE Circulars, e.g., Circular 19, 37), including accurate filing of cross-border payment declarations (e.g., GTS system for trade settlements, SAPS for service trade) and annual FDI/ODI registration updates.</li><li>
Collaborate with local tax authorities to align treasury activities with tax compliance (e.g., VAT on interest income, withholding tax on cross-border payments) and transfer pricing documentation.</li><li>
Build and maintain relationships with key banks to negotiate favorable credit terms, access new financing products, and resolve operational issues.</li></ul><p>
Cross-Border Coordination &amp; Global Integration
</p><ul><li>Act as the primary China treasury interface with the group&rsquo;s global headquarters, translating local needs into global strategies (e.g., aligning China funding plans with global cash pooling structures).</li><li>
Facilitate cross-border fund transfers (e.g., profits repatriation to the parent company, offshore loans to China subsidiaries) by ensuring compliance with both Chinese regulations (SAFE, PBOC) and global group policies (e.g., transfer pricing, tax efficiency).</li><li>
Integrate China treasury data into the group&rsquo;s global tool, ensuring accurate reporting and visibility for regional/global stakeholders.</li></ul><p>
Team Leadership &amp; Business Partnership
</p><ul><li>Supervise a local treasury team responsible for daily operations, including cash management, bank reconciliation, and regulatory reporting, with a focus on upskilling in China-specific treasury practices.</li><li>
Partner with China-based business units (sales, procurement, operations) to optimize working capital (e.g., reducing DSO, extending DPO) and provide proactive funding solutions for business growth (e.g., seasonal inventory buildup, new product launches).</li></ul><p><br>
</p><p><b>Qualifications (China Expertise + Global Mindset)</b></p><p>
Experience: Minimum 5 years of treasury experience in China, with at least 3 years in roles managing onshore RMB operations, cross-border treasury, or China finance for MNCs, foreign-invested enterprises, or large domestic corporates. Experience with SAFE compliance, cross-border fund flows, and local financing is critical. Technical Skills:</p><ul><li>
Deep understanding of China&rsquo;s financial regulations (SAFE, PBOC, CBIRC) and local banking practices (e.g., CIPS, NAPS, SWIFT for onshore/offshore links).</li><li>
Advanced Excel for cash forecasting and reporting.</li><li>
Familiarity with Chinese capital markets (e.g., interbank bond market, money market) and financing instruments (e.g., MTNs, ABS in China).</li></ul><p>
Language &amp; Cultural Fit:</p><ul><li>
Fluent in Mandarin (written/spoken) and English (business proficiency) for coordination with local banks, regulators, and global teams.</li><li>
Strong relationship-building skills to navigate China&rsquo;s business environment, including with domestic banks, tax authorities, and industry associations.</li></ul><p>
